          <h3>Innovation & Market Needs</h3>
          <div class="content">
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                The journey towards creating Verbelequence stemmed from Mike
                Brewer's prior experience in the financial services industry,
                where he recognized a pressing need for effective communication
                tools. Despite his background in economics and computer science,
                Brewer faced unexpected challenges, particularly with cold
                calling, during his venture into automation services.
              </p>
              <p>
                This struggle highlighted a gap in the market for a platform
                that could help individuals practice and improve their
                communication skills, specifically in scenarios like interviews,
                sales pitches, and negotiations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Brewer's personal journey and the difficulties he encountered
                ignited the inspiration to develop Verbelequence, driven by the
                desire to provide a solution to a prevalent market need.
